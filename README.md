Breakout a flash chip for Mats

It's a S66WV1M16EBLL-70BLI (https://mouser.se/datasheet/2/198/66WV1M16EALL_EBLL-1077555.pdf). Is it possible to break out a 0.75mm pitch BGA within the specs of, for instance, JLC? Their filled&capped via-in-pad service on 6/8L have a super deal now for 50x50mm boards with 0.3mm drills. Just $5 instead of $50.

Thanks. I have no real requirements in regards of pin ordering, nor the connectors. I guess that 50mil pinheaders would make a usable small interface. If they're kept as single row the board could easily be respun as reasonably small castellated board.

GPT4 did the pinout of the chip - but I can't share chats with images. Lame.
